Fundamentals of Angular

(1) Binding
    1. Class to Template Binding
        -> Interpolation {{}}
        -> Property Binding []
    2. Template to Class Binding
        -> Event Binding ()
    3. Both side Binding
        -> Two way Data Binding
            1. Split Binding: Property-Binding[] + Event-Binding()
            2. Getters & Setters (used private property)

(2) Component to Component Interaction
    1. using Input()
    2. using Getters & Setters
